# MyUI

A UI package for Flutter, loosely inspired by Blender's UI widgets.

## Widgets

+ `App` - `WidgetsApp` which has a `ThemeProvider` that styles all the other widgets.
+ `Button` - Button with default and ghost themes.
+ `Clickable` - Widget that handles cursor icon changes and provides click-related methods.
+ `ResizablePanels` - Like a `Row` or `Column`, but each element is resizable, initialized according to a given flex.
+ `Tabs` - Shows different widgets based on selected tab using tab headers which can also contain custom widgets.
